# LockTheDoor

This is a program that remotely opens and closes doors. However, it only simulates it (the data is not received from the server, 
but from the .json file in the root of the project). Written without storyboards, only SnapKit. Just one screen.
Functionality is limited: the settings and password buttons does not work.
